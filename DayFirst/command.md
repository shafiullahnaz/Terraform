Initialize the Project:
    Use the terraform init command to initialize your project. This sets up the working directory, downloads necessary provider plugins, and prepares your environment for further operations.
    
    terraform init
   
    Plan Changes:

    The terraform plan command generates an execution plan. It shows what actions Terraform will take to reach the desired state described in your configuration files. This allows you to review the changes before they are applied.
    terraform plan

    #the applay
    terraform apply
